# Realms_in_Exile_Tools
This repository is has the purpose of serving as a universal place for all the small tools I write for my mate @Jaco-Daan whom is working on the Realms in Exile mod for the steam game: Crusader Kings 3. 

filter.py: This script has the purpose of filtering through history texts and filtering for certain attributes. The script is written to have a resemblance to a deterministic finite automata for seamless integration and it uses regular expressions for filtering. It has a linear order of growth to the amount of characters in the history file.
